# Use set for hash storage for O(1) lookups.
# Parallel Processing: Use Pythonâ€™s multiprocessing or concurrent.futures to hash multiple words simultaneously.
# Handle Large Files: Use libraries like mmap for memory-efficient file handling.
# Progress Tracking: Use tqdm for a progress bar to monitor the cracking process.
# Prepare a test file with some hashed passwords and a matching wordlist.
